	<p class="para">Woke up this morning with a bitch that I don't know suckin' my dick
Watchin' CNN news, all of this poverty shit, how worse can it get
You say that you rich, then poverty hit, but we forever rich
Not what I psychologically meant, they want me to quit
You would do better making a Doberman sit
I rose for this shit, from one jail to another precinct
You told for this shit, this shit, you niggas sold for this shit
How old will it get before we start exposin' and shit?</p>

 	<p>Okay, lil mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair down her back like mine
I make her feel right when it's wrong like lyin'
Man, she ain't never had a love like mine
But man, I ain't never seen an ass like hers
That pussy in my mouth had me lost for words
So I told her back it up like, "burp, burp"
And made that ass jump like, "jerp, jerp"
And that's when she</p>
