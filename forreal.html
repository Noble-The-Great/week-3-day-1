	<p class="para">Woke up this morning with a bitch that I don't know suckin' my dick
Watchin' CNN news, all of this poverty shit, how worse can it get
You say that you rich, then poverty hit, but we forever rich
Not what I psychologically meant, they want me to quit
You would do better making a Doberman sit
I rose for this shit, from one jail to another precinct
You told for this shit, this shit, you niggas sold for this shit
How old will it get before we start exposin' and shit?</p>

Leave it to the double thick thighs, twin sisters
Drop it down and wobble, wobble up, mami booted up
She get down and gobble, gobble up 'cause my money up
Slide, slide in the Bentley truck-a, the Wraith truck-a
Your bestie is a dick sucker, I big dub her
As-salam-alam alaykum, you big hater
You nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser
